Chatbot: Profanity Detection Generative AI

This project is a Tkinter-based chatbot application that integrates a profanity detection model and a generative AI model to provide appropriate responses while filtering out harmful content. The application uses the unitary/toxic-bert model to classify and detect harmful content in user input and utilizes the Google Gemini API to generate responses.

Features:

Generative AI: Generates responses using the Google Gemini API if the input text is deemed safe.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

Theming Support: Includes options to switch between light and dark themes.

Sign-Up Feature: Allows users to sign up and save their credentials locally.

Copy to Clipboard: Copies the chatbot's response to the clipboard for easy sharing.
